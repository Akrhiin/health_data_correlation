Program #2

Short description:
The program takes user input of three (x,y) pairs of numbers as (temperature(F), respiratory rate(BPM)) and uses a formula to calculate the correlation coefficient and the strength of association, designating the points as having strong, moderated, or weak relation.

Files included:
README.txt     - this file
main.cpp       - source code for the correlation program
vitalSigns.cpp - gathers user input for temperature and respiratory rate
vitalSigns.h   - declare functions getBodyTemperature_F() and getRespirationRate_BPM()

Status of program:
All code tested and operational.
